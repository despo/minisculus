<h1>The Challenge</h1>

<p>In honour of the SC2010UK event held at Bletchley Park, we have decided to put forth a coding challenge loosely based on the historic efforts of the WWII code breakers.</p>

<p>To get started, it is recommended that you read the following Wikipedia articles.  This will give you sufficient background on the domain we are asking you to model.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_park">Bletchley Park</a><br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus computer</a><br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher">Lorenz cipher</a>

<p>Now that you have a brief historical grounding, we will start the challenge!  There will be a prize of a Â£100 <a href="http://amazon.co.uk">amazon</a> gift card for the craftsman who successfully completes the challenge.  The winner will be scored on how quickly they complete the task and how well crafted their final code submission is, as determined by Eden Development.</p>
<p>To judge the code entries we will need public access to your code repository, if you need repository hosting we suggest <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>.</p>

<p>There will be 5 questions you need to solve.  Good Luck!  Enjoy!</p>

<h2>To Access the Challenge</h2>

<p>To obtain the questions for the challenge you will need to use a JSON service to request each question.  Documention on how to use this service is found here: <a href="http://gist.github.com/602853">http://gist.github.com/602853</a></p>
<p>Please note that you will need to use the 'reference-url' attribute in the JSON data to get the information needed to solve the question.  Once you have sucessfully completed a question, then you will be redirected to the next question in turn.</p>
