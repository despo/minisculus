<h1>YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE</h1>

<p>We have taken the main city of FURLIN (known for it's rich history of fur trading).  Our troops are hunting the enemy high command.  We know that they are hiding in a BUNKER in a remote part of the city.</p>

<p>We have successfully reproduced the MARK IV machine, however we do not know what today's wheel settings are.  Therefore, we need to use our machine to crack though an encoded message we received today to find the wheel positions.</p>

<p>You should have received a coded message along with an email address. Once you have cracked the code and established what today's wheel settings are you must send the message along with the wheel settings and a link to your source code to the email address provided.</p>

<p>JSON QUESTION... Given the following encoded message which will contain clue words found in the above text once decrypted, what is the decoded message and what are the wheel positions?  (extra points are given to find all the possible wheel positions that will successfully decode this message). Email your answer to minisculus@edendevelopment.co.uk, along with public access to your code repository.  Your submission will be dated by email receipt and we will contact you soon.</p>
